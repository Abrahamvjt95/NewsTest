Simple news App using react, auth0 and localstorage

There are 2 types of users, administrator and author. If you register your account using a @gmail.com account, the user will be an administrator, otherwise it will be an author.

The administrator can edit,delete and publish all the news saved on local storage. The authors can edit only the ones made by themselves.
